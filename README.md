# Data Collection for .NET written in C#

An open-source example app demonstrating how to use the ArcGIS platform to collect features and related records, both online and offline, using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET.

Collect your own organization's data in an app driven by the ArcGIS Web GIS information model and configured through your organization's web maps. We provide an example _Trees of Portland_ web map and dataset to get you started.

_Coming summer 2018_

## SDK Usage

Data Collection leverages several aspects of the Runtime SDK including:

* Taking your web map and data offline
* Editing your data both offline and online
* Synchronizing offline edits
* Viewing and editing your data with Popups
* Working with Features, Popups and PopupManagers
* Editing and querying Feature Tables
* Working with related records
* Identifying map features
* Portal authentication with OAuth2
* Using the World Geocoder service
* Using Popup configuration to drive app behavior
